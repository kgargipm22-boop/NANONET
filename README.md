Invoice Data Extraction using Nanonets (No-Code AI)

🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how to convert unstructured financial documents (invoices in PDF/image format) into structured, usable data using Nanonets, 
a no-code AI platform for intelligent document processing.

The lab showcases how AI-powered automation can replace manual data entry, reduce errors, and accelerate financial workflows—without
writing a single line of code.

🎯 Objective

To learn and demonstrate how AI systems can:

* Extract key financial fields from invoice documents automatically
* Convert unstructured PDFs into structured datasets (Excel/CSV)
* Validate extracted data against business rules
* Answer natural language questions about invoice content

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional invoice processing faces significant challenges:

* Manual data entry is time-consuming and error-prone
* Unstructured formats (PDFs, scanned images) cannot be directly analyzed
* High volume processing creates bottlenecks in accounts payable
* Audit compliance requires accurate, traceable data extraction

The Scale of the Problem:
* 42 hours of manual work → 4 hours with AI
* ₹21,000 cost → ₹2,000 with automation

🏗️ Technology Architecture
